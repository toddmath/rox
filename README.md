My implementation of Lox language written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/ "Crafting Interpreters book").

An overview of the lox language can be found [here](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html).

Although, I plan on following the book closely, it is written in Java. Obviously, I am porting it to Rust,
so I am going to strike a balance between idiomatic Rust and the book's Java.
